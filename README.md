# Demo Installation of Drupal and GraphQL

This demo is created along with a screencast series ["Headless Drupal with GraphQl from scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkitwIEsz4riIjHgug6IRgz-698TSvKEF)

I will try to cover this topic from a developer point of view of a developer that:
* has a good knowledge of Drupal
* has not so much knowledge about GraphQL servers and may be even less of an implementation in PHP and Drupal
* has a fair knowledge of React
* has not so much knowledge of how a React GraphQL client works and may be even less on how to use it to query and mutate data for a Drupal CMS

## Screencast 01 - Setup and install Drupal together with the GraphQl module for local development

You can find the Screencast here on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1Gz-BVNx8&t=1s&list=PLkitwIEsz4riIjHgug6IRgz-698TSvKEF&index=1
